<h1>The Best Movies According to Kiran</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>Exciting, entertaining, and emotionally impactful, Avengers: Endgame does whatever it takes to deliver a satisfying
finale to Marvel's epic Infinity Saga </p>
<h3>GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 3</h3>
<p>A galactic group hug that might squeeze a little too tight on the heartstrings, the final Guardians of the Galaxy is a
loving last hurrah for the MCU's most ragtag family</p>
<h3>INTERSTELLAR</h3>
<p>Interstellar represents more of the thrilling, thought-provoking, and visually resplendent filmmaking moviegoers have
come to expect from writer-director Christopher Nolan, even if its intellectual reach somewhat exceeds its grasp.</p>
